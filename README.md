# VidAnimator

This is a short summer project of mine. The program takes mp3 audio and an image of any file type as input and displays a beautiful animation on the image while playing the music in the background.

Check out the code to make your very own!

## Steps:

In place of "sampleMusic.mp3", put your own music file and rename it "sampleMusic.mp3"
Replace "backgroundImage.png" with your own backgroundImage and rename it with the same title. Run the program and enjoy!
There are several other factors you can change in this peice of code. These are all initialized in the top few lines of the class VidAnimator.

## Going Forward

I would really appreciate it if you choose to contribute to this code. Going forward, I have many ideas and other changes that can be made to the code.

I was thinking of linking the color of the stars to the decibal volume of the music.
I will be adding a fog effect by increasing the brightness of certain portions of the background image creating a "travelling through clouds" effect.
Please feel free to help me with my other projects!
